## **Audio Features** 
----------
* **Track** - The Spotify ID for the track.
  
* **Artist** - The Spotify ID of the artist.
  
* **Danceability** - Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. 
  
* **Energy** - Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
  
* **Loudness** - Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). 
  
* **Speechiness** - Presence of spoken words in a track
  
* **Acousticness** - Whether the track is acoustic.
  
* **Liveness** - Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. 
  
* **Valence** - Musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
* **Tempo** - The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). 
  
* **Duration_ms** - The track length in milliseconds.
  
* **Year** - The year the song was released in. 
  
* **Weeks-on-board** - Number of weeks the song was on the Bill Board.
  
* **Charted** - Whether a song is a hit or non-hit.
